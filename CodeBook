Below is a list of definitions for the variable names of the output. Further down is a list of all objects 
used in my code with a description. 

Activity
Subject
tBodyAcc.mean...X
tBodyAcc.mean...Y
tBodyAcc.mean...Z
tBodyAcc.std...X
tBodyAcc.std...Y
tBodyAcc.std...Z

The results for the last 6 were given by calculating the average of each for all instaces of a given subject completing 
a distinct activity. i.e  a result in tBodyAcc.mean...X may be the average for all mean values of subject 2 
recorded while completing the activity walking.


features <- this is a list from features.txt in top level directory used as column names when reading data
actlabels <- this is a list from activity_labels.txt in top level which has 6 actvity descriptions relating to activity codes
trainact <- this is the actvity list from train/y_train.txt which has an ordered list of actvity codes for the train data
traindata <- data from train/X_train.txt which is all the measurements for the train data
trainsubj <- data from train/subject_train.txt which is an ordered list of subjects relating to measurements in traindata 
testact <- this is the actvity list from test/y_train.txt which has an ordered list of actvity codes for the test data
testdata <- data from test/X_train.txt which is all the measurements for the test data
testsubj <- data from train/subject_train.txt which is an ordered list of subjects relating to measurements in testdata 
tidytrain <- combination of all data for the train data
tidytest <- combination of all data for the test data
mergedata <- the completly merged data, test first then train
subjectactivity <- list of subjects and activity to use in aggregate function
avgtidydata <- Second data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
actvities <- Ordered list created with the activity labels and ordered by corresponding data from avgtidydata
